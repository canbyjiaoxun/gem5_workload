Follow the following steps to collect data under different input: 
1) mkdir a benchmark dir in benchmark/, e.g., cd benchmark && mkdir adpcm 
2) copy all source files to the adpcm dir, and then modify the main source file to generate a random input data, e.g., vim adpcm.c. For detailed
modification, plz see adpcm.c. 
3) Back to root dir and then modify the run.py to build, run adpcm and collect the corresponding data. Note modify the APP name in both run.py and
./analysis/data_collect.py
